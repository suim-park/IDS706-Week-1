# Python Github Repository
This repository demonstrates how to set up Continuous Integration (CI) for a Python project using **GitHub Actions**. This guide will help you automate tasks like installing dependencies, linting code, running tests, and formatting code every time you push changes to the repository.

## Getting Started

### What is GitHub Actions?
**GitHub Actions** is a powerful tool that lets you automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. For example, you can automatically run tests, check code formatting, and deploy applications when code is pushed to your repository.

### What You’ll Need
* A basic understanding of Python
*	A Python project with a Makefile set up for tasks like installation, linting, testing, and formatting
*	A GitHub repository where your project is hosted

### Setting Up GitHub Actions
1.	Create a Workflow File:
*	In your repository, go to the Actions tab.
*	Select “Set up a workflow yourself” to create a new YAML file.
*	GitHub will generate a basic `YAML file` named `main.yml` in the `.github/workflows directory`.
2.	Define Your Workflow:
*	In the main.yml file, specify the actions you want to automate.
*	Below is an example workflow:
```yaml
name: Python Application Test with GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: make install

    - name: Lint code
      run: make lint

    - name: Run tests
      run: make test

    - name: Format code
      run: make format
```

### What this does:
* Checks out the code from your repository.
* Sets up Python 3.8.
* Runs the commands defined in your Makefile:
* make install: Installs dependencies.
* make lint: Lints the code.
* make test: Runs the tests.
* make format: Formats the code.

3.	Run the Workflow:
* Every time you push changes to your main branch (or open a pull request), this workflow will automatically run.
* You can monitor the progress and results in the Actions tab of your repository.
4.	Debugging and Fixing Issues:
* If your code has issues (e.g., syntax errors), GitHub Actions will notify you by marking the workflow as failed.
* You can click on the failed workflow in the Actions tab to see detailed logs and identify the problem.

### Adding a Status Badge
You can add a status badge to your repository’s README file. This badge will show whether the latest build passed or failed.
```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/workflows/Python%20Application%20Test%20with%20GitHub%20Actions/badge.svg)
```

## Why Use Continuous Integration?

* Consistency: Ensures that your code is always tested and validated before being merged.
* Quality: Helps maintain high code quality by catching issues early.
* Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on writing code.

Setting up CI with GitHub Actions is a best practice for any Python project and will help you deliver higher-quality code faster.

This README provides a beginner-friendly introduction to setting up and using GitHub Actions for CI in a Python project. It walks through the basic steps and explains the purpose of each part of the process.
